Prisma is an **Object Relational Mapping (ORM)** for working with databases.

**Why ORM?**

1. ORM minimizes the amount of Query Language knowledge required to connect a database to an application. 
2. ORMs also automatically generate the SQL code.
3. Increase the productivity of developers, allowing them to focus on generating business logic.
4. Code Reuse.
5. Reduced Testing.

Prisma is an open-source next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- **Prisma Migrate**: Migration system
- **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database

Working with relational databases is a major bottleneck in application development. Debugging SQL queries or complex ORM objects often consume hours of development time.

Prisma provides a clean and type-safe API for submitting database queries that return *plain-old JavaScript objects.*

### Features of Prisma

- **Thinking in objects** instead of mapping relational data
- **Queries not classes** to avoid complex model objects
- **Single source of truth** for database and application models
- **Type-safe database queries** that can be validated at compile time
- **Less boilerplate** so developers can focus on the important parts of their app
- **Auto-completion in code editors** instead of needing to look up documentation

### Prisma Setup (*basic*)

*Detailed Setup: [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres)*

1. Initialize the Nodejs project and install the required packages
`npm init -y 
 npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev`
2. Initialize the Prisma with 
`npx prisma init`
3. Now Connect your database.
Configure your datasource with the required providers (PostgreSQL, SQL, MongoDB) and DB_URL
4. Create a database schema and then migrate it.
`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
It creates a new SQL migration file and runs SQL against the database.
5. Install Prisma Client
 `npm install @prisma/client`
now just by importing the Prisma-client we can communicate with DB and can perform operations.

### **Why Prisma?**

| **Category** | **Prisma** | **Type-ORM** | **Query Language / DB tools** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Productivity**  | High | Medium | Low |
| **Control** | Medium | Medium | High |
| **Model Definition** | uses a custom Schema Definition Language (SDL) | uses classes and decorators. | Structured Query Language |
| **Type Safety** | Highly typed safe. Provides Prisma client through which we can communicate with DB and auto-completion. | provide type safety but falls short in some situations. In case of selecting a subset of a query result. | Does not provide any type-safety |
| **DB Compatibility** | It is compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, CockroachDB, Microsoft SQL Server
 | It Supports MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, CockroachDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SAP Hana. | It is not compatible with single DB only |

**Pros :**

1. Type-safe database access
2. Open Source
3. Auto-generated query builder
4. Supports multiple database systems
5. Increases confidence during development
6. Built specifically for Postgres and TypeScript
7. Productive application development
8. Supports multiple RDBMSs
9. Robust migrations system

**Cons :** 

1. It lacks a DBAL (Database Abstraction Layer)
2. Can be intimidating to beginners
