**What is the Nodejs framework?** 

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime JavaScript environment that enables you to write server-side applications. It runs on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and thus runs JavaScript outside the web browser.

[**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/) is an open-source framework that helps you build scalable Node.js server-side applications. Heavily inspired by Angular, it is built on Typescript and uses progressive JavaScript. It has a simple design with 3 main components: controllers, modules, and providers.

## **NestJS Architecture**

![nestjs architecture](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4HvTgUFGeQse53g04p7r_V21EnzqPgaM_rf3BlhNv6LfSnYF_QqDhZKcrGleRNSiGYgjZV_OHVDotewsVdnrE2lKjTQIArpmH4don_uRZeB6KdPhNWrS0ABtsCJEaG-lL6DMB6WBHFsxv0Rxiyo11IYh7qLOZadiz_aV2usRhFcIpLxKMQSn-MWnDA)

**Modules :**

A module allows you to group together related controllers and service providers.

**@Modules()** **decorator is used for modules.

**Controllers :**

It is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them

**@Controller(),** it groups a set of route handlers together that are responsible for processing the request under a base endpoint.
Nest supports @Get, @Post(), @Put(), @Delete(), @Header(), @UseFilters(), @UsePipes(), @All(), and other Route handler decorators.

**Service Providers :**

It encapsulates related business logic and function into a single class.

Nest collects the list of providers defined by all modules in the application, creates a single instance of each provider, and injects the provider instance to any controller requesting it.

**@Injectable()** decorator that helps in injecting the service into any controller.

## Features :

- It combines the elements of OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
- It supports various databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Apache Cassandra, etc.
- NestJS is platform agnostic - it uses Express by default but you can configure it to work with any HTTP framework like Fastify.
- It provides a wide range of functionalities, APIs, and libraries so that developers can build applications with fewer lines of code.
- It was created for building Monoliths and [**Micro-services**](https://www.solutelabs.com/blog/microservices-nestjs).
- It contains a built-in Dependency Injection container thus keeping your code clean, and easy to read and use.
- You can easily integrate with technologies such as Mongoose, Prisma, TypeORM, GraphQL, and concepts like Logging, Validation, Caching, and Web Sockets.

## Pros :

- Extensible: Thanks to its modular architecture, NestJS is flexible and allows you to use the other existing libraries within your project (more on this below).
- Architecture: NestJS has a project architecture that provides testing, scaling, and maintenance
- Versatile: Provides an adaptable ecosystem
- Progressive: NestJS makes use of JavaScript functions and implements mature solutions and design patterns in software development
- TypeScript: Leverages TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript
- Documentation: NestJS encourages documentation thanks to the use of decorators.
- Testing: due to dependency injection and modularity, performing testing becomes much simpler.
- CLI: NestJS includes its own CLI tool for project management and handling scaffolding is definitely nice to have.

## Cons :

- Scaffolding: In NestJS, everything has a highly defined structure, so sometimes we can get lost or derailed in generating or navigating so many files.
- Learning Curve: New developer needs to learn the framework, it is not as easygoing as Express.
- A whole lot of magic: magic means that something is working just because it is working. Until it stops working, that is. There are instances where doing certain things would be a thousand times simpler if done with Express rather than NestJS, and when a developer encounters these blockers, they will need someone more experienced to assist them. Someone with knowledge of dependency injection, and experience working with more seasoned frameworks like Spring.
- Feels Old: Given its resemblance to .NET Core, Spring and others.

## NestJS vs ExpressJS

| **Categories** | **NestJS** | **ExpressJS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Opinionated or Not** | It is Opinionated. | It is Unopinionated |
|  | Focuses more on conventions and principles. | Doesn’t have pre-defined rules to follow |
|  | Develop applications less prone to error. | Can assume and experiment with code and its implementation. |
|  |  |  |
| **Architecture** | Provide ready-to-use components like controllers, providers, and modules. | Has no proper structure. Applications might end up being inefficient and less optimized. |
|  |  |  |
| **Type-Safety** | Support Typescript by default, more reliable and suitable to develop large-scale apps | Does not support Typescript, the dev has to manually set it up.|
|  |  |  |
| **Performance** | Have Nest CLI that allows generating boilerplates for projects | Is asynchronous. Can execute multiple operations independently. |
|  | Dependency injection allows multiple dependencies to run your app smoothly | No scalable |
|  |  |  |
| **Popularity** | Slowly gaining popularity | Older Framework so more popular and has a bigger user community |
|  | Ranked second among most starred Nodejs frameworks. (ac. GitHub) | Ranked at top of Nodejs Framework as per GitHub |
|  | Companies using Nest: Adidas, Capgemini, Decathlon, Autodesk, and more. | Companies using Express: Netflix, IBM,eBay, Paypal, etc.  |
|  |  |  |
| **Unit Testing** | Easy and fast as CLI includes default testing env. configured in jest.  | Need to write separate code for testing |
|  | Auto-generates testing bed code. | Time-consuming, slows down the app's productivity. |
|  |  |  |
| **Use Cases** | Better suited for enterprise-level web apps | Suited for building fintech and streaming applications as live streaming is complex with multiple levels of data streams. |
